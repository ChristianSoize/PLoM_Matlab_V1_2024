# Brief Description of the PLoM Software

The PLoM (Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds) software is a MATLAB-based toolbox designed to perform advanced probabilistic modeling 
and learning on manifolds. It is particularly useful for analyzing high-dimensional data from small datasets, reducing dimensionality, 
and capturing complex relationships in data through a probabilistic approach. The toolbox provides various types of analyses that 
facilitate the construction of probabilistic models on manifolds and statistical surrogate models, making it a powerful tool for 
researchers and practitioners in fields such as scientific machine learning, data science, and applied mathematics.

The development of the PLoM software is grounded in the research published in the articles listed at the end of this file.  Numerous 
applications of this software can also be found in the published literature.

The software's capabilities are demonstrated through 9 Benchmarks. Each Benchmark illustrates a specific type of analysis that can be 
performed, with fully defined data sets and the associated results generated by PLoM.

A Python version: "PLoM_Python_V1_2024", of the Matlab package: "PLoM_Matlab_V1_2024" is available on GitHub.

# How to use PLoM Software 

PLoM starts with the Matlab function run.m, in which two main parameters must be provided by the user: the number nbworkers, which 
determines the number of workers for parallel computation, and the parameter ind_workflow, which specifies the type of analysis as follows:

- "ind_workflow = 1": WorkFlow1_SolverDirect_WithoutPartition
- "ind_workflow = 2": WorkFlow2_SolverDirect_WithPartition
- "ind_workflow = 3": WorkFlow3_SolverInverse_WithoutPartition

**For executing PLoM:**

(1) Create a directory "Name", for instance: "PLoM_project1".

(2) In this directory "Name":
- Place the subdirectory "PLoM_software_MATLAB_functions_V1" (do not change the name), which contains all the Matlab functions of PLoM.
- Create a subdirectory "subName" (for instance, Benchmark1_Direct_NoPartition_CondStat_pdf) containing the function:
   - run.m (whose content is defined above)
   - and:
     - If ind_workflow = 1: two functions, mainWorkflow_Data_WorkFlow1.m and mainWorkflow_Data_generation1.m, and one data file, 
                            FileMatRxxData, are required.
     - If ind_workflow = 2: two functions, mainWorkflow_Data_WorkFlow2.m and mainWorkflow_Data_generation1.m, and one data file,
                            FileMatRxxData, are required.
     - If ind_workflow = 3: three functions, mainWorkflow_Data_WorkFlow3.m, mainWorkflow_Data_generation1.m, and 
                            mainWorkflow_Data_generation2.m, and two data files, FileMatRxxData and FileMatRxxTargetj with j = 1, 2, 
                            or 3 for target type 1, 2, or 3, are required.

(3) To execute PLoM, open Matlab in the subdirectory "subName" and enter: "run" in the prompt.
